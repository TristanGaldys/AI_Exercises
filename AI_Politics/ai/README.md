# Political Affiliation Prediction Project

## Overview

This project utilizes a decision tree classifier to predict a person's political affiliation based on their responses to a series of questions regarding various policy and societal issues. The classifier is built using the J48 algorithm from the Weka machine learning library, analyzing survey data to make predictions.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html)
- [Weka software](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)

### Instructions
1. Ensure you have Java and Weka installed on your system.
2. The ARFF file containing the necessary data has been handled for you. However, if you wish to retrain the model, simply rerun `DecisionTree.java`.
3. To use the political quiz, run `Main.java`.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start using the political quiz to predict political affiliations based on the responses to the survey questions.

## Conclusion

This project offers a streamlined approach to predicting political affiliations using decision tree classification. It is designed to be user-friendly, allowing anyone to make predictions without requiring a deep understanding of the underlying machine learning concepts.
