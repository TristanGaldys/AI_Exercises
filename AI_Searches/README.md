As you may be aware, backtracking is one of the most efficient ways to provide a solution in a constraint-satisfaction problem. The maze problem is a kind of constraint-satisfaction problem where you have to be in the boundary and reach the destination. For that, we will be using two basic types of searching techniques of backtracking: Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS). 

## To Run this code you must run these following commands in the Terminal:
To compile the files run the following command:

     javac .\src\search\maze\*.java

To Run the Breadth First Search run

    java -cp src search.maze.MazeBreadthFirstSearch
To Run the Depth First Search run

    java -cp src search.maze.MazeDepthFirstSearch
